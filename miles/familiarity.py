"""Familiarity: how often the athlete's own activity tracks have covered each
section of an area, matched from the raw streams already on disk.

Matching is incremental. An activity is matched against an area's sections
once; the result lives in net_section_visits until a rebuild replaces the
sections, which clears it (sections.delete_area_sections) and so re-matches
everything. A query never matches anything itself: it reads the visits and
reports how many activities are still waiting.
