    Positional "work block" approach: warmup and cooldown are defined by where they
    sit relative to the fast laps, not by pace — so warmup miles are separated from
    interval recoveries even when their paces overlap.

    1. Split fast/slow at the largest relative speed gap ("steady" if no gap >= 6%).
    2. The work block spans first to last fast lap; laps before/after are
       warmup/cooldown, slow laps inside are recovery.
    3. A second gap split inside the block separates jog recoveries from reps when
       the session-level gap landed at the cooldown instead.
    4. Block-edge laps with HR far below the work median, pace materially slower,
       and a non-modal distance are trimmed to warmup/cooldown (catches warmup
       miles that pace alone can't separate, e.g. before MP flux).
    5. In-block recovery laps at near-work HR become "float" (continuous work,
       e.g. flux slow halves), distinct from true jog recoveries.

    Known limitation: uphill reps invert the pace signal (slow pace, high HR) and
    classify as float rather than work.
