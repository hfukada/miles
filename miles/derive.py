"""
Recompute of every value derived from raw synced rows (activities/laps).

Raw synced data is ground truth; everything here is rebuildable from it. `derive_all(
full=True)` — used by the `miles-derive` CLI and forced automatically on a stale
DERIVE_VERSION — always recomputes from scratch, so a `git pull` that changes a
classifier or threshold only needs that rerun to take effect everywhere, including
ad-hoc `run_sql` queries. The default, incremental path scopes each pass to
meta.derive_dirty_since (see db.mark_derive_dirty and _derive_all_incremental's
docstring for why each pass's scoping cannot diverge from a full recompute).

One-pass contract: fitness checkpoints are computed twice. Race-effort classification
judges each race against its own estimate_fitness(as_of=race_date - 1 day) — never a
shared monthly checkpoint, which could span past the race and let it contaminate its
own prediction. Pass 1 (all races) instead seeds the pace-based race-inference step,
which reads the checkpoint of the month *before* an activity's month; pass 2 (excluding
casual-effort races) is the final, refined checkpoint table other tools read. Neither
pass's checkpoints are fed back into effort classification.

    _type_laps, _race_effort_pass and _lap_intensity_pass are scoped to DATE(start_date)

    classifies one activity from a trailing window that ends at or before that

    ever feed back into an earlier activity's derived values. _fitness_checkpoints is
    scoped by calendar month on the same reasoning (see its docstring).

    apply_inference and _pace_based_race_inference are the exception — both always run
    in full. apply_inference unconditionally resets and re-derives run_type_inferred
    for every workout_type=0 row on every call (cheap, ~0.4s); _pace_based_race_inference
    then fills in whatever apply_inference left NULL, including activities pace-inferred
    as races on a prior run. Both are pure functions of an activity's own backward-
    looking history, so they reproduce identical results for pre-`since` activities
    every time — but only because they run over the whole table: scoping either one
    to `since` would leave old pace-inferred races wiped by apply_inference's reset
